# From SQL Injection to Shell

## Introduction
This exercise features a web application that is vulnerable to SQL Injection and a Command Injection vulnerability within the admin panel.
The user needs to be able to chain these vulnerabilities together in order to successfully compromise the target and complete the exercise.

Though this exercise is short, I believe that it is a good starting point for beginners to learn and for anyone who wants to brush up on their exploitations skills. In order to complete the exercise the user must do the following:
- Analyze and identify the technologies in use
- Identify the vulnerabilities
- Exploit the vulnerabilities
- Chain the vulnerabilities together to gain code execution on the target.
